Lighthouse Labs 21-Day Coding Challenge in Javascript

# Day 1 Door to Door
Given an array of volunteer names and an array of neighbourhood names, complete the doorToDoor function so that it returns the number of neighbourhoods each volunteer should visit if the work of going door to door is split evenly amongst them.

# Day 2 Something to Talk About
Given a question topic, complete a function interviewAnswer(topic) that returns your stance on that particular election issue. The answer should be returned as a string.

When asked about arts funding, the function should return "We'll have to get creative!"
When asked about the economy, the function should return "Time is money."
When asked about transportation, the function should return "It's going to be a long road, so we better get moving."
If you're asked about a topic that isn't in the list above, respond with a default statement. (For example, "QUACK!")
