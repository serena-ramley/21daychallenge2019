Lighthouse Labs 21-Day Coding Challenge in Javascript

# Day 1 Door to Door
Given an array of volunteer names and an array of neighbourhood names, complete the doorToDoor function so that it returns the number of neighbourhoods each volunteer should visit if the work of going door to door is split evenly amongst them.

# Day 2 Something to Talk About
Given a question topic, complete a function interviewAnswer(topic) that returns your stance on that particular election issue. The answer should be returned as a string.

When asked about arts funding, the function should return "We'll have to get creative!"
When asked about the economy, the function should return "Time is money."
When asked about transportation, the function should return "It's going to be a long road, so we better get moving."
If you're asked about a topic that isn't in the list above, respond with a default statement. (For example, "QUACK!")

# Day 3 Securing The Vote
When a resident casts their vote, the system will be passed the name of the candidate they voted for and the current standings. It will then update the standings, adding the new vote to the count.

To test the system, we'll need to complete the function castVote(name, votes) that takes in the name of a candidate and an array of tallied votes. The function should return an array with the updated standings.

We will be testing the system with three possible candidates: Tim, Sally and Beth. Each item in the votes array represents the number of votes for a particular candidate:

The first item in the array votes[0] are the votes for Tim
The second item in the arry votes[1] are the votes for Sally
The third item in the array votes[2] are the votes for Beth
For example in this array [0, 2, 1] there are 0 votes for Tim, 2 votes for Sally and 1 vote for Beth.

# Day 4 Reminder To Vote
Complete the function registerToVote(name, unregisteredVoters) that takes in the name of a newly registered voter and an array of names of those who have not yet registered to vote. Your function must return an array, with the newly registered voter's name removed.

# Day 5 Voting Station Calculation
Complete the function chooseStations(stations) that takes in an array of possible voting stations, and then only returns the names of the stations that are appropriate.
Your function will receive an array of stations, where each station itself is an array with a name, a capacity, and a venue type.
In order for a station to be deemed appropriate, it must have a capacity of at least 20, and be a school or community centre.

# Day 6 Voter Turnout
Complete the function voterTurnout(), that will take in two arrays. The first array is a list of voter ids, and the second array is a list of voter signatures, which correspond to the voter ids. Our task here is to first check that each array have the same number of items and then confirm that each of the voter ids matches the corresponding voter signature.

If the arrays do not contain the same number of items, then we know something is amiss and our function should return false. If they contain the same number of elements, then we should proceed to check if the two arrays are identical, meaning they contain the same names in the same order. If they are, our function should return "All clear, we can count the votes!", if they are not it should return "FRAUD!".

# Day 7 Voter Surveys
We need to go through the survey responses to see what your constituents would like you to focus on over the course of your term in office. The array that you are given contains many phrases and words pulled from a number of interviews. We only want to focus on the following three key phrases: "smart city", "arts funding", and "transportation".

Our termTopics function needs to count how many times each of those topics was mentioned in the surveys, and then return an array with the number of mentions in the following order: smart city, arts funding, and then transportation.

# Day 8 Trash To Treasure
We need to complete a function called smartGarbage(trash, bins), which will be responsible for increasing the garbage count for waste, recycling, or compost depending on what trash is submitted. Our function will receive two arguments. The first argument, trash, is a string that will tell our function what type of item is being submitted. The second argument, bins, is an object containing three properties (waste, recycling, and compost), which hold some numerical value. Our function must increase the correct value in the bins object, and the return the newly updated object.
